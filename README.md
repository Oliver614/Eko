# Eko
Multi-tap Diffusion Network reverb 
#
Modelled on the Rounds Reverb by native istruments with some additional features not found on the orginal. 

Eko uses a multi-tap diffusion network topology with LFO driven diffusion timings to try and help maximise the diffusions through the 8 diffusion stages.

Low Diffusion and Size, with high Feedback gives more metalic sounding noises while high Diffusion Feedback and Size give massive lush reverbs. 
# Installation

Just drag and drop the built VST files from the release folder into where you VST's are stored for your DAW, the restart you daw or resccan the folder to recognise the changes. 

# Controls
Pre-Delay - Predelay controls the amount of thime it takes for the imput signal to reach the reverb, giving a greater sense of space. Current max and min times 0 - 2 s.

Pre-Delay Feedback - Feeds back the delayed signal back into the delay buffer. 

Diffusion - Controls where in the diffusion network the output signal is tapped from, giving a less or more diffuse sound. 

Feedback - Controls how much of the reverb is fed back on itself, creating longer tails.

Size - Controls the stereo field of the reverb as well as how long the tails last. 

Center - Moves the diffusion timings together.

Spread - Increases teh spread of the diffusion timings. 

HP/LP - Filters the incoming signa. 

Colour - Filters post Reverb  > 0 is highpass, < 0 lowpass.

Emphasis - sets a slight resonance at the colour level. 

Mix - Controls the wet dry level.

# Known issues

Changing the diffusion timings can cause some clicking noises, interpolation needed to fix this.

UI needs some changes.
